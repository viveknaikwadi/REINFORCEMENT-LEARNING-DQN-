Reinforcement Learning (DQN)
Introduction
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general framework where agents learn to perform actions in an environment so as to maximize a reward. The two main components are the environment, which represents the problem to be solved, and the agent, which represents the learning algorithm.
The agent and environment continuously interact with each other. At each time step, the agent takes an action on the environment based on its policy  , where  is the current observation from the environment, and receives a reward  and the next observation from the environment. The goal is to improve the policy so as to maximize the sum of rewards (return).
